=head1 NAME

A REPL to experiment with L<Term::ReadLine::Perl5>

=head1 Synopsis

    treps.pl # enter the shell

The program serves several purposes.

For the person who interacts with L<Term::ReadLine::Perl5> as a result
of using a program that makes use of this library
e.g. L<Devel::Trepan>, this program can be used to give you an
understanding of what the capabilities are and how you might bind keys
to make use of the libraries editing capabilites.

For the person who wants to use the L<Term::ReadLine::Perl5> API, this
is a pretty solid example of how to use this library. It contains (or
will contain) a multi-level dynamic completion, and how to interact with
history.

It can also be used as an example for how to write a command shell
where:

=over

=item *

each command is its own module with OO properties like, help text, min
and max arguments

=item *

command help text is in pod format that appears nicely on terminals
while also appearing nicely in the POD that appears publically

=item *

the number of parameters passed are checked for validity

=item *
each command can control its command completion

=back

=head1 HELP!

There's much that can be done here. Please also feel free to modify
for other readlines like L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> or L<Caroline>.
